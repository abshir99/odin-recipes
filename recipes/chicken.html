    <h2>Crumbed Chicken Tenderloins (Air Fried)</h2>
    <p>These air fryer chicken tenderloins beat chicken nuggets any day and the recipe is so simple. 
    I tend to use chicken tenderloins but you can use sliced chicken breasts if easier.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>Â½ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>8 chicken tenderloins</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps (Directions)</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Whisk egg in a small bowl. Mix bread crumbs and oil together 
            in a second bowl until mixture becomes loose and crumbly.</li>
        <li>Dip each chicken tenderloin into the bowl of egg; 
            shake off any residual egg. Dip chicken into crumb mixture, making sure it is evenly and fully covered. 
            Lay chicken tenderloins in the air fryer basket in an even layer.</li>
        <li>Air-fry until no longer pink in the center, about 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer 
            inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
